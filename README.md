# August (working title)

August is an Emmet-like language that produces JSON, TOML, and YAML (and potentially Nix). It allows you to quickly write selectors to create and edit documents. Other targets supported by `serde` can potentially be supported.

The current code is a small POC to play with the syntax, there is no functional CLI / editor extension (yet).

Please feel free to open issues with syntax suggestions / general suggestions if you want to become involved!
